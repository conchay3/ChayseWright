							<p>The first thing I learned growing up on a farm was work. The second thing was asking why we work that way. The third thing was looking for a better way to work. After working with my family for the first years of my life I started working for employers. That started at the age of 12 and has continued each year up until now. Each employer I have had has become a friend, and my friends know that I can help them with their problems. As my addiction to problem solving grew, I spent two consecutive years in Central America, learning how to speak a new language, doing full time, seven days a week, self-financed volunteer work. During that time I was able to help hundreds, if not thousands of friends with the problems they faced. Now I am trying to sate my addiction to problem solving with engineering, but it doesn't seem to be working.</p>
